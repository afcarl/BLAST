Usage: iMatsh target.features target.powers sourceFeatureList.txt sourcePowerList.txt MediaList.txt shingleSize hopSize [loFeature beta numHits]

Matrices are stored in binary files. The format is architecture independent:
values are stored as binary IEEE little-endien float row major

target.features  - file containing matrix of features for target, one row per observation
target.powers    - file containing vector of powers for target, one value per observation
targetFilename.wav - media file of target (for blending with matched audio)
sourceFeatureList.txt  - list of filenames for database source feature matrices "
sourcePowerList.txt    - list of filenames for database source power vectors "
MediaList.txt - list of filenames for source media (.wav format)
shingleSize   - number of feature vectors to stack for similarity search
hopSize       - number of observation time-points to skip per query
[loFeature=1]   - start index of first useful element in feature vector
[beta=2.0]      - mixing parameter 
[numHits=3]     = number of nearest neighbours to retrieve in similarity search
